Softcut Algorithm
 - walk over all node-versions
   - walk over all bboxes
     - if the current node-version is inside the bbox
       - record its id in the bboxes node-tracker

 - walk over all way-versions
   - walk over all bboxes
     - walk over all way-nodes
       - record the way-node-id in the current-way-node-vector
       - if the way-node is recorded in the bboxes node-tracker
         - record its id in the bboxes way-id-tracker

     - if its id is in the bboxes way-tracker
       - walk over the current-way-node-vector
         - record its id in the bboxes extra-node-tracker

 - walk over all relation-versions
   - walk over all bboxes
     - walk over all relation-members
       - if the relation-member is recorded in the bboxes node- or way-tracker
         - record its id in the bboxes relation-tracker

Second Pass
 - walk over all node-versions
   - walk over all bboxes
     - if the node-id is recorded in the bboxes node-tracker or in the extra-node-tracker
       - send the node to the bboxes writer

 - walk over all way-versions
   - walk over all bboxes
     - if the way-id is recorded in the bboxes way-tracker
       - send the way to the bboxes writer

 - walk over all relation-versions
   - walk over all bboxes
     - if the relation-id is recorded in the bboxes relation-tracker
       - send the relation to the bboxes writer

features:
 - if an object is in the extract, all versions of it are there
 - ways and relations are not changed
 - ways are reference-complete

disadvantages
 - dual pass
 - needs more RAM: 325 MB per BBOX
